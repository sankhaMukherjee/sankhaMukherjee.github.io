Who Am I?

I am a bit of a explorer of sorts. I dabble in computers, data science, Latin dance, math, photography, cooking, painting, and anything else that pops into my mind at a particualr time.

I Love lists. So here goes:

 - **Science**: Physics > Math > Chemistry > Biology
 - **Dance**: Zouk > Salsa > Bachata > Kizomba
 - **Computer** Language: Python > Anything else so far
 - **Food**: Indian > Japanese > Mexican > Italian
 - **Paint**: Oil > Watercolor > Acryllic
